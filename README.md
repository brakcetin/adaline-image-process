## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of the Adaline algorithm, a type of single-layer neural network, applied to basic image processing and pattern recognition tasks. The code walks through the steps of preparing image data, training the Adaline model, and using it to classify or recognize patterns in images.

## What is Adaline?

**Adaline (Adaptive Linear Neuron)** is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification. It consists of a single-layer neural network that updates its weights based on the Least Mean Squares (LMS) rule. Adaline is an early precursor to more complex neural networks and is particularly useful for understanding the fundamentals of machine learning.

## How Does This Code Work?

- **Image Preparation:**  
  The notebook demonstrates how to load and preprocess simple image data so it can be fed into a neural network. Images are typically converted to grayscale and flattened into vectors.

- **Adaline Model Implementation:**  
  The Adaline algorithm is implemented from scratch or using helper libraries. The model is trained on the image data to learn to distinguish between different patterns or classes (for example, different shapes or handwritten digits).

- **Training Process:**  
  The model iteratively updates its weights to minimize the error between its predictions and the actual image labels.

- **Classification/Recognition:**  
  After training, the Adaline model is used to predict the class of new, unseen images.

## Output

- **Model Training Visualization:**  
  The notebook displays plots of the error rate over training epochs, helping users understand how the model learns.

- **Prediction Results:**  
  After training, the notebook shows visual comparisons of input images and the model's predictions, indicating whether the Adaline algorithm correctly classified or recognized the patterns.

- **Performance Metrics:**  
  The notebook may output accuracy, error rates, or confusion matrices to quantify the model’s effectiveness.
